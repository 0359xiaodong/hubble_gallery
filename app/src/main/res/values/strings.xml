    <string name="info_1">The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into
        low Earth orbit in 1990, and remains in operation. With a 2.4-meter (7.9 ft) mirror, Hubble\'s
        four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared spectra.</string>

    <string name="info_2">Hubble\'s orbit outside the distortion of Earth\'s atmosphere allows it to take
        extremely high-resolution images with negligible background light. Hubble has recorded some of
        the most detailed visible-light images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time. Many
        Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as accurately determining
        the rate of expansion of the universe.</string>

    <string name="info_3">The content showcased in this app comes from HubbleSite, run by
    the Space Telescope Science Institute\'s Office of Public Outreach.
    This is not an official app, though I wish it was (if you\'re from NASA email me), I just think Hubble is awesome.</string>
